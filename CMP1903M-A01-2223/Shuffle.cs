    // == Fisher-Yates Shuffle Method ==
    // =================================
    // This method is based on the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm
    //
    // Description of the algorithm:
    // It is a modern algorithm that is considered to be the best way to shuffle a deck of cards
    // The algorithm effectively puts all the elements into a hat;
    // It continually determines the next element by randomly drawing an element from the hat until no elements remain.
    //
    // Steps to reproduce the algorithm:
    // 1. Write down the numbers from 1 through N.
    // 2. Pick a random number k between one and the number of unstruck numbers remaining (inclusive).
    // 3. Counting from the low end, strike out the kth number not yet struck out, and write it down at the end of a separate list.
    // 4. Repeat from step 2 until all the numbers have been struck out.
    // 5. The sequence of numbers written down in step 3 is now a random permutation of the original numbers.

    // ===========================
    // == Riffle Shuffle Method ==
    // ===========================
    // This method is based on the riffle shuffle algorithm
    //
    // Description of the algorithm:
    // The riffle shuffle is a method of shuffling a deck of cards.
    // It is a simple method that is easy to perform and can be done in the hands.
    // The deck is divided into two halves, and the halves are shuffled together.
    // The halves are then divided into two smaller halves, and the halves are shuffled together again.
    // This process is repeated until the deck is shuffled. (For this algorithm, this is not carried out)
    //
    // Steps to reproduce the algorithm:
    // 1. Split the deck into two halves.
    // 2. Shuffle the halves together by releasing the halves at the same time and allowing them to interlace.
    // 3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the deck is shuffled. (For this algorithm, this is not carried out)

    // == No Shuffle Method ==
    // =======================
    // This method is based on the no shuffle algorithm

    // It is a simple method that is easy to perform and can be done in the hands.
    // The deck is not shuffled at all.
    //
    // Steps to reproduce the algorithm:
    // 1. Do nothing.
